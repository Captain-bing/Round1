Welcome! This is **P**PSUC **v**s. **Z**JNU **M**achine **L**earning **C**hallenge (abbr. **PvZMLC**), a mini team contest founding for better understanding of machine learning algorithms including the classical and the deep.

The topic missions in the PvZMLC are well designed around the fields of data mining and computer vision in order to take advantages of two research group directions. The goals of the contest are to examinate how good we have learnt about machine learning algorithms and to reflect how to apply those amazing papers to complicated but funny scenes. We believe that this progress will show algorithms are not cold and dull mathematics all the time but reachable and available. Just relax and enjoy! The winning or losing is not important and we hope to hold an interesting studying event for everyone, two groups of friends. 

As the founders of PvZMLC, we both are so excited to announce the very first round topic. Action stations!
